       Controlling false match rates in record linkage using extreme value theory.
       Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 2011 (in press). 
       -- Predicted attribute: matching status (boolean).
       -- Results:
          -- A new approach for estimating the false match rate in record 
             linkage by methods of Extreme Value Theory (EVT).
          -- The model eliminates the need for labelled training data while
             achieving only slighter lower accuracy compared to a procedure
             that has knowledge about the matching status.

4. Relevant Information:

  The records represent individual data including first and 
  family name, sex, date of birth and postal code, which were collected through 
  iterative insertions in the course of several years. The comparison
  patterns in this data set are based on a sample of 100.000 records dating
  from 2005 to 2008. Data pairs were classified as "match" or "non-match" during 
  an extensive manual review where several documentarists were involved. 
  The resulting classification formed the basis for assessing the quality of the 
  registryâ€™s own record linkage procedure.
  
  In order to limit the amount of patterns a blocking procedure was applied,
  which selects only record pairs that meet specific agreement conditions. The
  results of the following six blocking iterations were merged together:
  
    1. Phonetic equality of first name and family name, equality of date of birth.
    2. Phonetic equality of first name, equality of day of birth.
    3. Phonetic equality of first name, equality of month of birth.
    4. Phonetic equality of first name, equality of year of birth.
    5. Equality of complete date of birth.
    6. Phonetic equality of family name, equality of sex.
    
  This procedure resulted in 5.749.132 record pairs, of which 20.931 are matches.
  
  The data set is split into 10 blocks of (approximately) equal size and ratio
  of matches to non-matches.

  The separate file frequencies.csv contains for every predictive attribute 
  the average number of values in the underlying records. These values can, for example,
  be used as u-probabilities in weight-based record linkage following the
  framework of Fellegi and Sunter.
   

5. Number of Instances: 5.749.132

6. Number of Attributes: 12 (9 predictive attributes, 2 non-predictive, 
                             1 goal field)

7. Attribute Information:
   1. id_1: Internal identifier of first record.
   2. id_2: Internal identifier of second record.
   3. cmp_fname_c1: agreement of first name, first component
   4. cmp_fname_c2: agreement of first name, second component
   5. cmp_lname_c1: agreement of family name, first component
   6. cmp_lname_c2: agreement of family name, second component
   7. cmp_sex: agreement sex
   8. cmp_bd: agreement of date of birth, day component
   9. cmp_bm: agreement of date of birth, month component
   10. cmp_by: agreement of date of birth, year component
   11. cmp_plz: agreement of postal code
   12. is_match: matching status (TRUE for matches, FALSE for non-matches)
