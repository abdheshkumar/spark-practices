Mary had a little lamb
It's fleece was white as snow, yeah
Everywhere the child went
The lamb, the lamb was sure to go, yeah
He followed her to school one day
And broke the teacher's rule
And what a time did they have

A green and yellow basket, now
I wrote a letter to my baby
And on my way I passed it, now
